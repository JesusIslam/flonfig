## Dependencies
- `go get github.com/BurntSushi/toml`

## What
Just like what the subtitle says, it is created so you (well, me actually) could turn a config file into flags automatically.

## Why
Because I want a flexible config flag and I don't want to define the flags hardcoded. Essentially, because I am a lazy bum.

## How
Just open the examples directory.

## TODO

## Notes
Also, I would gladly accept PR.
